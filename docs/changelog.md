# changelog

## 0.0.1 - 2023-02-18

added basic functionality:

* codes
* encode
* length
* decode

still 0.0.1 and not starting with 1.0.0 because:

not sure if there should be a better api for dealing with larger inputs,
e.g. considering supporting Node.js Buffer or [Typed Arrays][Typed Arrays],
encodings such as hex/base64, etc...

[Typed Arrays]: https://mdn.io/typed-arrays
